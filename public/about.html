<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm an up-and-coming web tech enthusiast from Camden, New Jersey, driven by a passion for creating innovative HTML websites and striving to make a significant impact in the tech world. My journey is fueled by a desire to excel and make a difference, not just for myself, but for the communities I serve.

  I proudly embrace my Puerto Rican heritage, with roots tracing back to the vibrant town of Utuado, Puerto Rico. This cultural foundation has instilled in me a strong sense of identity and purpose, guiding my path as I navigate the tech landscape..</p>

<p>In addition to my tech aspirations, I am deeply committed to my role as an ESL teacher in Camden, New Jersey. For the past 11 years, I've had the privilege of working with incredible children, helping them overcome language barriers and achieve their educational goals. This experience has not only shaped my career but has also enriched my life in countless ways.

  As I look to the future, I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. One of my personal goals is to travel the world, gaining new perspectives and experiences that will further inspire my work. I am also dedicated to becoming the best version of myself, continuously learning and growing both personally and professionally..</p>

<p>On a more personal note, my life is about to take a beautiful turn with the arrival of my baby boy. This new chapter brings immense joy and motivates me to push even harder towards my dreams. I am committed to upgrading my life in every way possible, creating a legacy that my family can be proud of.
